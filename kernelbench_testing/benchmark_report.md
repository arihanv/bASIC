# KernelBench Results for DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B

## Executive Summary

We attempted to test the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on KernelBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate efficient GPU CUDA kernels. The benchmark tests whether LLMs can transpile operators described in PyTorch to CUDA kernels.

Unfortunately, we encountered persistent connection issues with the LLM endpoint, which prevented us from successfully generating any CUDA kernels. Despite these technical difficulties, we were able to set up the benchmark environment, create the necessary integration code, and run the benchmark scripts on both Level 1 and Level 2 problems.

## Benchmark Setup

We successfully set up the KernelBench environment by:
1. Creating a Python virtual environment
2. Installing all required packages from KernelBench/requirements.txt
3. Installing KernelBench in development mode
4. Downloading the KernelBench dataset from Hugging Face

We also created a custom inference server function that integrates the user's LLM endpoint with KernelBench. The function handles streaming responses correctly and includes options for verbose output and timing.

## Integration Testing

We tested the custom inference server with a simple prompt ("What is the capital of France?") and received a correct response, confirming that the basic integration with the LLM endpoint was working.

However, when we attempted to run a single sample test with a more complex prompt for generating a CUDA kernel, we encountered issues with the model's response. The model started generating a response but was cut off before completing it.

Additionally, we discovered that the machine we were using doesn't have a GPU with CUDA support, which is required for evaluating CUDA kernels. As a result, we modified our approach to focus only on generating the kernels without attempting to evaluate them.

## Benchmark Results

### Level 1 (Single-kernel operators)

We ran the benchmark on problems 1-10 of Level 1, but all attempts failed due to connection issues with the LLM endpoint. The first problem encountered an error "Engine loop is not running. Inspect the stacktrace to find the original error: RuntimeError('Cannot handle cases where distributed draft workers generate no tokens')", and the rest of the problems had connection errors "upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: remote connection failure, transport failure reason: delayed connect error: 111".

**Summary Metrics:**
- Total problems: 10
- Successful generations: 0 (0.00%)
- fast_0 (correctness rate): 0.00%
- fast_1 (correct and faster than PyTorch): 0.00%
- fast_2 (correct and at least 2x faster): 0.00%

### Level 2 (Simple fusion patterns)

We ran the benchmark on problems 1-10 of Level 2, but encountered the same connection errors with the LLM endpoint as we saw with Level 1. All problems failed with connection errors.

**Summary Metrics:**
- Total problems: 10
- Successful generations: 0 (0.00%)
- fast_0 (correctness rate): 0.00%
- fast_1 (correct and faster than PyTorch): 0.00%
- fast_2 (correct and at least 2x faster): 0.00%

## Technical Challenges

1. **LLM Endpoint Connection Issues**: The most significant challenge was the persistent connection issues with the LLM endpoint. These issues prevented us from successfully generating any CUDA kernels.

2. **No GPU with CUDA Support**: The machine we were using doesn't have a GPU with CUDA support, which is required for evaluating CUDA kernels. This limitation meant that even if we had successfully generated kernels, we wouldn't have been able to evaluate them for correctness or performance.

3. **Incomplete Model Responses**: In the few cases where we did receive a partial response from the model, the response was cut off before completing the CUDA kernel implementation.

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate LLM Endpoint Issues**: The connection issues with the LLM endpoint need to be resolved before further testing can be conducted. This may involve checking the endpoint's availability, stability, and capacity to handle complex prompts.

2. **Use a Machine with GPU and CUDA Support**: To fully evaluate the model's performance on KernelBench, a machine with a GPU and CUDA support is required. This would allow for both generation and evaluation of CUDA kernels.

3. **Adjust Model Parameters**: If the model is struggling to complete the generation of CUDA kernels, adjusting parameters such as maximum token length or temperature might help.

4. **Retry with Smaller Batch Size**: Instead of running the benchmark on 10 problems at once, trying with a smaller batch size or even one problem at a time might help identify if there are specific problems that the model can handle better than others.

## Conclusion

While we were unable to successfully generate and evaluate CUDA kernels using the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model due to technical challenges, we have set up the necessary infrastructure and scripts for testing. Once the connection issues with the LLM endpoint are resolved and a machine with GPU and CUDA support is available, the benchmark can be run again to properly evaluate the model's performance.

The KernelBench benchmark remains a valuable tool for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate efficient GPU kernels, and with the right setup, it could provide valuable insights into the capabilities of the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model in this domain.
